I'll analyze the current implementation against the requirements in slack-clone.md.

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Authentication & Workspace Management**
- Firebase authentication with AuthContext and useAuth hook
- Multi-workspace support with WorkspaceContext
- Basic workspace creation and switching

2. **Channel Management**
- Public/private channels implementation
- Channel creation with CreateChannelDialog
- Channel list with ChannelList component
- Member management for private channels

3. **Real-time Messaging**
- Basic message functionality with MessageContext
- Real-time updates using Firebase
- Message threading support (basic structure)
- File attachments with preview support

4. **UI/Layout**
- Responsive layout with mobile support
- Workspace navigation
- Channel sidebar
- Message thread view
- Loading states and error handling

**Missing Features:**

1. **Direct Messages**
- DM conversations
- Group DMs
- DM-specific UI

2. **Enhanced Messaging**
- @mentions
- Message reactions
- Message pinning
- Message search

3. **Notifications**
- Push notifications
- In-app notifications
- Unread message counts

4. **User Features**
- User status
- User profile customization
- User search improvements
- Workspace-specific settings

5. **Enhanced Channel Features**
- Channel archiving
- Channel renaming
- Starred/pinned channels

**Suggested Next Steps:**

1. Implement Direct Messages:
```typescript
// New types needed in src/lib/types/slack.ts
interface DirectMessageChannel {
  id: string;
  participants: string[];
  type: 'dm' | 'group';
  lastMessage?: string;
  lastMessageAt?: string;
}
```

2. Add a DirectMessageList component alongside ChannelList:
```typescript
// New component: src/components/messages/DirectMessageList.tsx
interface DirectMessageListProps {
  workspaceId: string;
  onSelectDM: (dmChannelId: string) => void;
}
```

3. Enhance MessageContext to handle both channel messages and DMs:
```typescript
// Update src/lib/contexts/MessageContext.tsx
interface MessageContextType {
  messages: Message[];
  sendMessage: (message: Omit<Message, 'id'>) => Promise<void>;
  sendDirectMessage: (message: Omit<DirectMessage, 'id'>) => Promise<void>;
}
```

This approach builds on the existing real-time infrastructure while expanding to support direct messaging, which is a core feature missing from the current implementation.

The codebase shows good foundation with Firebase integration, real-time updates, and component structure. The next phase should focus on direct messaging and enhanced user interactions.
